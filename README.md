# Carbon Literacy Training Analysis in Kenya's Hospitality Sector

This repository contains data analysis and visualization work for assessing the impact of carbon literacy training in Kenyaâ€™s hospitality sector. The project aims to demonstrate how sustainability initiatives influence energy savings, carbon reduction, and revenue impact.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on:
- **Estimated Carbon Reduction** and **Energy Savings** due to training.
- The **impact of pre- and post-training initiatives** on sustainability KPIs.
- The **revenue impact** from eco-conscious practices.

The **data cleaning and transformation** was performed using Python, while the **visualizations** were developed in Power BI.

## Repository Contents

- **`carbon_literacy.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning and transformation.
- **`carbon.png`**: Power BI dashboard visualizing the insights from the cleaned data.
- **`final_dataframe.csv`**: Cleaned dataset in CSV format, ready for analysis and visualization.

## Data Cleaning Techniques

The data cleaning process involved the following steps:

1. **Standardizing Text**:
   - Converted text in relevant columns (e.g., `KPI_Area`, `Global_Benchmark`, `Pre_Training`, `Post_Training`, `Estimated_Carbon_Reduction`, `Revenue_Impact`) to lowercase and removed any leading or trailing whitespace for consistency.

2. **Removing Parenthetical Information**:
   - Used regular expressions to remove any text within parentheses across several columns, keeping only the essential information.

3. **Extracting Percentage Values**:
   - Defined a custom function, `extract_percentage`, to capture and extract percentage values from text in the `Global_Benchmark`, `Post_Training`, and `Estimated_Carbon_Reduction` columns.
   - Extracted percentages were stored in new columns like `Post_Training_Percentage` and `Estimated_Carbon_Reduction_percentage`.

4. **Splitting Columns**:
   - Split the `Post_Training` column into separate columns for text and percentages, creating `Post_Training_Percentage`.
   - A similar approach was applied to the `Estimated_Carbon_Reduction` column.

5. **Refining Revenue Impact Data**:
   - Removed any text after a colon (":") in the `Revenue_Impact` column to retain only the primary revenue impact description.

6. **Removing Periods**:
   - Removed periods from all columns to maintain consistency across the dataset.

## Viewing the Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the project's key insights. It visualizes metrics such as:
- Estimated Carbon Reduction and Energy Savings.
- Post-training energy savings and carbon reduction by KPI area.
- Revenue impact from sustainability initiatives.
